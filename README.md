Juka is a portable, easy-to-use, universal programming language that can run on any platform, including mobile devices, IoT devices, and the cloud. Its philosophy is “code once, run everywhere.”

JukaAI is a natural language programming, which means you can write code in plain English and Juka will try to understand and execute it.

Juka is still under development, but it has the potential to be a major player in the programming language landscape. Join our Discord Community: [![Discord](https://img.shields.io/discord/975787212954275910)](https://discord.gg/MsKWsErzfp)
