JukaAI is a natural language programming, which means you can write code in plain English and Juka will try to understand and execute it.

Juka is still under development, but it has the potential to be a major player in the programming language landscape. Join our Discord Community: [![Discord](https://img.shields.io/discord/975787212954275910)](https://discord.gg/MsKWsErzfp)
